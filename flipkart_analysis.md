## Quick Metadata
- Libraries imported: (detected from notebook code)
- Datasets referenced (file paths found in notebook): flipkart reviews dataset (check notebook for exact path)
- Models referenced (detected in code): Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, BERT (verify in notebook)
- Evaluation metrics used (detected): accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, confusion_matrix

## Analysis Summary
This notebook implements a sentiment analysis pipeline for Flipkart product reviews. The notebook follows a typical NLP workflow: data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF / embeddings), model training (classical ML and deep models), evaluation, and visualization.

### Data & Preprocessing
- Confirm dataset loading and inspect `head`, `shape`, and class distribution to detect imbalance.
- Clean text: lowercase, remove HTML tags, punctuation, emojis, URLs, and normalize repeated characters.
- Apply tokenization and lemmatization (or stemming) as needed.
- Consider balancing techniques (SMOTE for numerical features; for text, consider class weighting or data augmentation).

### Feature Engineering
- For classical ML models, use TF-IDF with n-grams (unigram + bigram) and limit vocabulary size.
- For neural models, prefer pretrained embeddings (BERT tokens or GloVe/Word2Vec) and pad/truncate sequences to a fixed length.
- Add auxiliary features: review length, rating, verified purchase flag, presence of emojis/exclamation marks.

### Models & Training
- Ensure stratified train/validation/test split to preserve label distribution.
- Use cross-validation (stratified k-fold) for robust performance estimates.
- For deep models like LSTM and BERT, use GPU acceleration and tune batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
- Save best model checkpoints and tokenizers.

### Evaluation & Results
- Use F1-score (macro and weighted), precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for a balanced evaluation under potential class imbalance.
- Plot confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
- Report per-class metrics to highlight minority class performance.

### Recommendations
1. Prefer fine-tuning BERT for best contextual performance if GPU resources are available.
2. Use class weights for neural nets and/or SMOTE for classical models to address class imbalance.
3. Implement desensitization for noisy text (spelling correction, slang mapping).
4. Add explainability (SHAP/LIME) to show which words drive predictions.
5. Build a reproducible inference pipeline and save preprocessing steps.

## Suggested File Outputs

- `models/vectorizer.pkl` — TF-IDF vectorizer or tokenizer
- `reports/classification_report.md` — final evaluation metrics
- `notebooks/flipkart_sentiment_analysis_final.ipynb` — cleaned notebook with outputs

If you want, I can now:
- Extract exact metrics and model outputs from the notebook cells.
- Create an interactive summary (tables + charts) from notebook results.
